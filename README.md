## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science student in Germany. On this account I showcase some of the projects I made or contributed to.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Masters Degree.

Some additional projects I contributed to are:
- ![oneshot-web](https://github.com/ptrLx/oneshot-web) : A self-hostable app to remind you of the special moments! (I mainly worked on the frontend using ionic vue)
